### CPSC 120

* Lab 6

I enjoyed lab 06, part 2 because it helped me create something interactive. In addition, it was a fun program! Writing something that was user-friendly was fun. 

* Lab 9

Lab 09, part 2 was fun because it helped me use boolsand vectors. I enjoyed learning about different types of values. This program was tough but fun to write!

* Lab 10

Lab 10, part 3 was fun because I learned how to use color to create images. The use of RGB was enjoyable. I know these will be useful in the future.
